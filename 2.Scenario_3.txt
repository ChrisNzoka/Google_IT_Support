    - Hardware management: Implement hardware lifecycle for proper hardware management
    Rationale:
    - Hardware lifecycle allows for maintenance and recycling. Used machines can be recycled and provisioned to new employees.
    - Recycling helps to remove the cost of purchasing new machines.

Process Improvement #2
    - Move email services to cloud.
    - Introduce the use of Slack for instant messaging amongst teams.
    Rationale:
    - Managing email server onsite is not advisable as it costs more. There are free or cheap cloud email services.
    - Taking email services to cloud frees up infrastructure for file server.
    - It is risky to manage multiple services on a single server. A downtime for one service means a downtime for all.
    - Instant messaging allows for swift comunication.

Process Improvement #3
    - Organize users in OU's according to roles in the Active Directory (AD).
    - Design GPO's for software installations and configuration for authenticated user machines upon boot up and login.
    - Ship softwares to machines using the AD.
    - Delist all users who have exited the company.
    Rationale:
    - Proper use of AD helps to deploy softwares qucikly to users.
    - Removing exited members from the domain is very important to protect access from an outsider.

Process Improvement #4
    - Replace the ticketing system with a more user friendly alternative.
    - Provide tutorials and guides on the new ticketing software to employees.
    - Develop documentation system to record all IT related processes and tasks to be performed by employees.
    Rationale:
    - A user friendly working environment improves productivity.
    - Guides and tutorials help users to understand the functionalities of what they use.
    - Proper documentation reduces the work of the IT support staff.

Process Improvement #5
    - The files should be backed up online depending on the data size. Several cloud services offer free backups for certain data sizes.
    - Troubleshoot the reasons why the website keeps going down.
    - Write a post morterm report on the last downtime.
    - Document the process of bringing it back online and grant access to other authorized staff.
    Rationale:
    - A mobile data is exposed to risk of loss on transit. Cloud backup saves the stress as files are better secured.
    - The documentation allows someone else to troubleshoot and bring the website back online on the absence of IT Support.
