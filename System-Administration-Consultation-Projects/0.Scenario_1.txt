Process Improvement #1
    - Improvement of infrastructure procurement: The HR personnel should undertake vendor research to familiarize themselves with the vendors.
    - Working with Manufacturers:  Contract and set up a business account with a trusted vendor.
    - Improved Hardware Management: Implement Hardware Lifecycle which calls for reserving hardware in case of emergency.
    Rationale:
    - The knowledge of vendors and their products helps to decide on a vendor to procure by considering quality and price.
    - Working with manufacturers will help to streamline Infrastructure and enhances compatibility as the majority of the company machines come from one manufacturer.
    - This will also reduce the cost of procurement as manufacturers would offer discounts to regular customers.
    - New employees are provided with machines from the reserve before a new machine is procured. This will curb time wasted before new can start working.

Process Improvement #2
    - Hardware tracking: Label all company Hardware.
    - Name machines following the company standardized naming system.
    - Develop a company Hardware inventory for all existing hardware.
    Rationale:
    - Labelling hardware helps employees to keep track of what belongs to the company and that which belongs to them(employees).
    - Hardware inventory helps to track hardware lifecycle.

    - New employees would be work-ready upon going through the documentation provided on resumption.
